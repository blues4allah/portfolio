				<h3>I met with team leaders to set high-level organizational goals</h3>
				<p>Goal #1: Increase user engagement</p>
				<p>To prevent churn, we wanted to make sure users were getting the full value from the product and performing key actions.</p>
				<p>Goal #2: Decrease time to first value</p>
				<p>We observed a trend where teams that were quick to onboard, were more likely to successfully use Zoomforth to accomplish their own goals. As a result, these teams were more engaged and grew quickly. We set out to decrease the numbers of days it takes users to publish their first site and teams to deliver their first site to visitors.</p>

				<h3>I conducted usability studies and measured current app analytics</h3>
				<p>I met with 5 generalists and 5 designers to observe them accomplish different workflows in the app. I then set up analytics to measure the current status of our key performance indicators:</p>
				<p>Active users: 87.2%<br>
						Engaged users: 47.9%<br>
						Avg days to user’s first publish: 41<br>
						Avg days to team’s first visit: 51

				<h3>We revolutionized our ability to aggregate product insights from disparate sources</h3>
				<p>We used ProductBoard to collect insights from customer discovery interviews, support conversations, sales calls, usability studies, and internal feedback. We created a prioritized list of features and improvements that would contribute to our goals. Then, engineers gave us difficulty estimates and we agreed on a development timeline and split up the work into sprints.</p>

				<h3>I led the implementation of dozens of usability improvements & launched a new onboarding process</h3>
				<p>I used Sketch and InVision to create mocks and prototypes, solicited feedback from our team and external stakeholders. After engineers developed a feature, I refined the CSS, pushed to a staging server, and guided our support team as they QA'd different browsers and devices.
				</p>
				<p>I also collaborated with internal teams to organize a new onboarding process, with new tutorial videos, as well as branded assets to get new customers up and running.

				<h3>We increased app engagement by 14% and decreased the time to first value by 11 days</h3>
				<p>As we launched new features, we messaged users through Intercom, and we updated our public Productboard portal so users could leave comments. We found that our development efforts successfully contributed to our goals by measuring key performance indicitators at the end of 2019:</p>
				<p>Active users: 94.5% &emsp; <span class="pink">Δ +7.3%</span><br>
					Engaged users: 62.1% &emsp; <span class="pink">Δ +14.2%</span><br>
					Avg days to user’s first publish: 33 days &emsp; <span class="pink">Δ -8 days</span><br>
					Avg days to team’s first visit: 40 &emsp; <span class="pink">Δ -11 days</span>
